     Hi, I'm Yasemin. I am married and am a mother of <em>two chiweenies</em>.
     I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey. I moved to the US five years ago,
     and went to school for my master's degree and married to my husband during this time.
     My husband and I moved to Portland almost two years ago.
     As of know, I am working as an analyst in a private company.
     I really love codding, and I am happy to learn in <strong>Epicodus</strong>.
