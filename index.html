     Hi, I'm Yasemin. I am married and am a mother of <em>two chiweenies</em>.
     I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey. I moved to the US five years ago,
     and went to school for my master's degree and later married my husband.
     We moved to Portland from Texas almost two years ago.
     As of know, I am working as an analyst for a private company.
     I really love coding, and I am happy to be working with <strong><a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a></strong>.
